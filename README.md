# CaesarCipher 🔐

A simple Python implementation of the **Caesar cipher**, an encryption technique that shifts letters by a given number of positions in the alphabet.

## Features ✨

- Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged
- Interactive user input

encode
Type your message:

Type the shift number:

Here is the encoded result: khoor
```
